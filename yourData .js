    `
    Hello, my name is Nori Hess and i'm a web developer with a background of design. My past roles taught me how to identify and find creative solutions while working with multidisciplinary methodologies.

I'm traditioning into development becasue I have a strong affinity for problem solving and developing apps, websites, ect beyond looks. I love a good challange and full-stack development is going to keep my on my toes and my mind sharp. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, who happens to be able to design as well. I believe being able to know the methodologies behind UI/UX and development will help me be successful in the future.

I'm currently living in the Denver area and I'm ready to tackle the workforce!
